# REU @ Portland State University

A repository that includes projects that were made during the first two weeks for training for the REU. This is also where i documented my learning progress from 6/09 to 6/20

### June 9th
Lessons Learned
* Leararned the basics on dynamical systems
* Understanding the expectations of the program, things to keep in mind.
Progress
* Read chapters one through 3, interesting, ive seen these concepts before but this seems more in depth with what i've learned previously.
* Reached out to my team member to begin to discuss workflow
Next steps:
* Finish Chapter 4 and begin working on the Podcast

### June 10th
#### Lessons Learned
* Introduction to research!
* Learning how to become a successful research student!
#### Progress
* Began reading and researching with my team member what to present.
#### Next Steps:
* Tidy up the presentation, bring everything together

### June 11th
#### What did i learn?
* We learned about linear and nonlinear dynamics,
#### Progress
Did some progress on the presentation
#### Whats Next?

## Project One: Discrete-Time Models of Belief Dynamics
We modeled a closed, well mixed population whise members can hold one opf a few opinions. 
In every time step, people may switch camp according to simple repeatable rules.

### June 12th 
#### What did i learn?
* Learned about some helpful resources to find papers, i like Research Rabbit a lot, it looks like it could be super useful tool.
#### Progress
* Worked on the team study presentation
#### Whats Next?
* present our study and begin working on our mini project two!
* 
### June 13th
#### What did i learn?
* We learned about how to properly read research papers.
* Embrace AI, because it's seeming to not go away anytime soon.
#### Progress
* Finishing touches on project 2, i seemed to have done too much programming to where i didn't know where to start in the presentation, but it was awesome to learn about graphing in Java.
#### Whats next?
* begin to look into Agent based models
* Contact faculty mentor,
* Relax for the weekend!
  
## Project Two

### June 16th
#### What did i learn?
* The introduction to Agent based models, Interesting topic.
* I learned about the opportunity of being in the editorial team, i might be interested in this.
#### Progress
* Began writing some information on the getting started tutorial.
#### Whats next?
* Share with team!

### June 17th
#### What did i learn?
* More information on Agent based models
* Learning about consistent writing, i think i write best when it's on paper.
#### Progress
* Worked on project three, due to time restrictions, fundamental models were presented, but i have updated the program to include some more models.
#### Whats next?
* Begin to work on a new getting started tutorial.


## Project Three
The random network represents a road network connecting cities where nodes are cities and roads are links.<br> 
The virtual environment in the ABM is composed of a set of roads, cities, and empty space (forest). <br>
An agent in the ABM is a car that drives on the road (cannot drive in forest).  <br> 

**Understanding the ABM** <br>
We used a grid-world approach: the environment is split up into a # of grid cells. <br>
Agents (cars) can only move from one grid cell to the next. <br>
Grid cells have a limit on how many cars/people can occupy them. <br>
We also keep track of which cities cars have visited. <br>

### June 18th
#### What did i learn?
* began to do some research on neural networks and their behavior, we also got to see the history of AI, which is cool to know that its always been around.
#### Progress
* Finish up Getting statred tutorial, adding some final touches and i think we are good to go!
* Met with Dr. Ofori-Boateng and discussed our upcoming research project.
#### Whats next?
* Start working on our final mini project

### June 20th
#### What did i learn?
* I continued to learn about neural networks, looks like we can also use databases to test out all sorts of things like hand recognition, car prices, etc.
#### Progress
* We finished up on readin on these neural networks, im very interested in what these things do, i might have gotten carried away testing them out, but i think thats the cool part of the process.
* I was able to generate graphs and a heatmap, but i think we used too few runs for the graph to actually see a good change in the programs behavior.
#### Whats next?
* Start on the research proposal!

* 
## Project 4 Neural Networks and the Recognition of Directed and Undirected Graphs with Adjacent Matrices.
